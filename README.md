# **House Price Prediction**
---

## Overview
This project is a House Price Prediction App built using Streamlit and Simple Linear Regression. The app predicts the price of a house based on the square footage of the living area. It leverages a machine learning model trained on a dataset of house prices and features a user-friendly interface for input and output.

##  Simple Linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method to find the relationship between two variables:
- Independent Variable (X): The input (e.g., square footage).
- Dependent Variable (y): The output (e.g., house price).

Equation:
          y=mx+c

Where:

- m: Slope of the line (how much y changes for a unit change in X).
- c: Intercept (value of y when X = 0).
- **Role of Simple Linear Regression in the Project**
  Purpose: Establishes a linear relationship between square footage and house price.
  Training: The model learns parameters m and ùëê from the training data.
  Prediction: For any given square footage, the model predicts the house price using the learned equation.
  By using simple linear regression, the app provides an easy-to-understand prediction mechanism while keeping the implementation straightforward and interpretable.

## Dataset
- **Source:** The dataset used is the Salary_Data.csv file (should be replaced with a housing dataset).
- **Features:**
  **Independent Variable (X):** Square footage of the living area.
  **Dependent Variable (y):** House price.
- **Structure:**
  **Rows:** Data points (examples of houses).
  **Columns:** Feature (square footage) and target (price).

## Data Preprocessing Steps
1. **Data Loading:**
   Read the CSV file containing house price data.
   Extract the independent (X) and dependent (y) variables.
2. **Data Splitting:**
   Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing) using train_test_split.
3. **Scaling/Transformation:**
   For simple linear regression, scaling is not required unless the data values have extremely large ranges.
4. **Model Training:**
   Fit a linear regression model on the training data using LinearRegression.fit().
